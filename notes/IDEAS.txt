- Pre-projection to determine pixels needing a ray before radiation
- oriented object (ex with plane, visible on one side not on the other)
- Photon Mapping
- Bump Mapping (Perlin)
- Voxel (3D Grid)
- scene description file
- use cuda computing
- use SIMD
- use MPI

Voxels must be used in an intersection tree
The voxel tree has a root voxel, each tree node has exactly eight or no child
