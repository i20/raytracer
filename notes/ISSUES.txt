  #1 double precision 0 != 1e-13 tests must be rewritten
v #2 camera looking away sees the scene because intersections are computed between object/line without caring about origin point
v #3 move orientation look and normal correction on Object to factorize code
  #4 bad intersection detection if object is a patatoid and that calcuted ray to light intersects again with it (way_scal <= 0?)
  #5 attenuation of punctual lights is too hard with r^2
  #6 strange illumination when punctual light is very near a surface
  #7 no possibility to deactivate reflection and refraction (attribute "is_translucid" in Object?)
v #8 confusion between octree's base (= scene base) and mesh's triangles' base (= mesh's base) cannot directly compare both since there are not expressed in the same base (problem occurs when (z_dir, y_dir) != (z, y))
  #9 camera move has weird behavior past a while
  #10 segmentation fault happens with tetrahedron
  #11 regression textures
